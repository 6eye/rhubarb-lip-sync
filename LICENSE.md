# License

## Summary

This summary is only meant to give you a quick overview. It is not legally binding. The actual license terms are defined by the quoted license texts below.

* Rhubarb Lip Sync and all of its components (libraries, resources, etc.) are under the MIT license or a similar permissive license. This means that you can use Rhubarb Lip Sync in almost any way you want. You may even create commercial software based on it.
* When you run Rhubarb Lip Sync on an audio file, the resulting lip-sync data belongs to you alone. This means that if you use Rhubarb Lip Sync in the production process of a video game, an animated cartoon, or a similar product *that doesn't ship with lip-sync functionality*, you don't even have to care about the MIT license.
