# Rhubarb Lip Sync

Rhubarb Lip Sync is a command-line tool that automatically creates lip-sync data from voice recordings. Just call it with a sound file in WAVE format and it will output an XML snippet specifying which mouth position to use for what segment of time. A reference to the mouth positions (A-H) can be found in [this article](http://sunewatts.dk/lipsync/lipsync/article_02.php).

Right now, Rhubarb Lip Sync is very much work in progress. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to open an issue.
